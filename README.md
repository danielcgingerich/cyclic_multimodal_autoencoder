# Multimodal autoencoder with cycle consistency loss for integration of unpaired single cell data

Here, we present an autoencoder-based framework for the integration of unpaired, multimodal single cell data. The model first learns a joint latent representation from modalities $X_0$ and $Y_0$ using paired data.  Then, unpaired data, $X$ and $Y$ is passed through the encoders
